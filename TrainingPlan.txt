Use a github repository.

Create a folder for each topic.

Put resources, notes, exercises, questions, chalenges, etc. in each related topic

Where to start:
    - Book: The art of software security assessment
    - Book: The web application hackers handbook
    - Page development resources in PSS
    - OWASP for each subject
        - Track the interesting resources
        - Take notes
        - Create questions
        - Code/request example
        - Take a look at the references
    - Troy Hunt blog for each subject
        - Try to find pratical examples
    - Find, understand and list major attacks (ex: Heartbleed)
    - Use the PSS Analysis items
        - lvl 0 - 1 - 2 first
        - Make sure you understand all of them in depth
    - For each subject, create questions with answers
    - Try to watch other pluralsight courses on security
    - Do the exercies/questions at the end of each chapters from The Application Hackers Handbook
