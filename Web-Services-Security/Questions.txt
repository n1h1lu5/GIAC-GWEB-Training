- What uses web services?
    Connected devices (phones, tablets, etc.)
    Connected things (IoT)

- What is a web service?
    Not loaded in the browser, but works in the background, like with apps
    Let any application communicate with any other application without having to consider the language it was developped in or the format of the data.

- Is it really different from web application on a security perspective?
    No, it is still all HTTP

    - What are some differences?
        Usually returns XML or JSON in responses instead of HTML
        Usually bearer tokens and or auth headers instead of cookies
        Increasingly sematic use of HTTP verbs  (more chances that verb tampering might work in services compared to web app)
        They are less visible so often less well tested
        They often depend on custom clients for certificate validation
        (More) Dangerous assumptions made from the developper (like, only the web app will talk to the API)

- At what levels security protections are required regarding web services?
    SOAP messages that are sent on the wire should be delievered confidentially and without tampering
    The server needs to be confident who it is talking to and what the clients are entitled to
    The clients need to know they ar etalking to the right server, and not a phishing site
    System message logs should contain sufficient information to reliably reconstruct the chain of events and track those back to the authenticated callers

- What is trust transitivity?
    Trusts between A,B and B,C does not automatically imply A,C trust relationship

- Could there be clear-text issues with web services?
    Yes, storage and local caches

- What issues must be adressed regarding the passing of credentials for web services?
    SOAP messages are XML based, so all passed credentials have to be converted to text format, can be a problem for binary ones (X.509 certificates or Kerberos tokens), need to base64 them
    Risk of credentials disclosure when passing credentials (trasmission or logs). Need to encrypt them (and even hash them if possible)

- How do you protect against replay attack?
    Use unique identifiers (nonces) on messages and keep track of processed ones, or a short validity time window

- How do you protect the message integrity?
    The web server must ask: Do I trust the caller? Did it created this message (not alterred along the way)? 
    You can use stuff like cryptographic signatures or private key encoding

- What are the access control considerations for web services?
    The web server must decide:
        Does it know who is requesting the operation?
        Does it trust the caller's identity claim>
        Does it allow the caller to perform this operation?
    Might be interesting to integrate an XML/SOAP firewall

- Audit, how would you ensure non-repudiation regarding the law with your logs?
    A cryptographic digital signature over any content that has to be legally binded, it can be reliably traced to the owner of the signed key.

- What is Web Services Description Languages? (WSDL)
    XML based comunication (SOAP over HTTP)
    An XML protocol for describing Web Services
    Can be used to describe web services based on an abstract model of what the service offers.
        Abstract functionnality from concrete details of a service description such as how and where that functionnality is offered
    Describe the interface of a service

- What is SOAP?
    Provides an XML-based framework for exchanging structured and typed information between peer services.

- What is SAML?
    Security specification that defines how identity, attribute and authorization assertions should be exachanged among participating services in a secure and interoperable way

- What are the core areas covered by the Web Services Security standard? (WSS)
    Way to add security headers to SOAP envelopes
    Attachment of security tokens and credentials to the message
    Inserting a timestamp
    Signing the message
    Encrypting the message
    Extensibility

    - What is the goal of the standard?
        Provide tiools for message-level communication protection
    - What are the types of token you can use?
        Username token
        Binary token (X.509 certificates base64'ed)
        XML token

- What are the mechanisms WSS propose for:
    - Integrity?
        XML-dsig (signature)
    - Confidentiallity?
        XML encryption standard
    - Freshness?
        Timestamp mechanism (creation and expiration moments)
            Applied to the WSS header, since each header could have its own timestamp

- What issues could rise when forming a web service chain?
    Incompatible user access control models
    Service trust (SSL certificate or same access control mechanism as with users, if you want something that is more flexible)
    Secure connections
    Synchronization of user directories
        How does service in domain B is going to trust user's claim that he has been already authenticated in domain A?
            SSO (user known in both domains)
    Domain federation

- What problems surround currently existing standards and their implementations?
    Immaturity of the standards
    Performance
        XML parsing is slow
    Complexity and interoperability
        Standards are complex
    Key management
        Homegrown mechanisms for key management run significant risks in many cases

- What are the security rules for:
    - Transport confidentiality?
        Use TLS
    - Server authentication
        TLS must be used to authenticate the service provider to the service consumer
            Consumer must checks: Certificate issued by a trusted provider, is not expired, is not revoked, matches the domain name of the service, private key is associated with the public key certificate
    - User authentication?
        Basic auth must be done over TLS
        Client certificate authentication using TLS is recommended
    - Transport encoding?
        Enforce the same encoding style between the client and the server
    - Message integrity?
        XML digital signatures using the sender's private key. Can be validated using the sender digital certificate (public key)
    - Message confidentiallity?
        Encrypted using string encryption cypher
        Remain encrypted at rest with strong data encryption
    - Authorization?
        On every request, check the privileges of the authenticated user
        Admin functions only accessible to web service administrators
    - Schema validation
        Validate SOAP payload to associated XSD
        XSD should define the maximum length and character set for every parameter or Regex
    - Output encoding
        Preventing XSS
    - Virus protection
        There is the ability to attach files and document to SOAP messages, so ensure that virus scanning technology is installed to check attachment before saving on disk
    - Message size
        Limit SOAP messages size to mitigate DoS attacks
    - Availability
        Validation against recursive payloads
        Validation against oversized payloads
        Protection against XML entity expension (XML bomb)
        Validating against overlong element names.

- What are the actual clients of webservices?
    Other backend servers, generally not web front-ends

- How do you protect against parsing exploits? (can lead to DoS)
    Do not implement custom parsers
    Validate the XML stream size before the XML parsing

- Is SOA a type of distributed system?
    Yes

- How can you mitigate the risks of an open network?
    By segmenting infrastructure services into logical groupings that have the same communication security policies and security requirements.
        For example, put everything public together, and everything restricted together, put a perimeter between each group so that it cannot be accessed directly
