- What is the common way to associate a user with a session?
    The user has a session token, usually a cookie (ex: AuthCookie).

- What are others way to transmit session token?
    Hidden form fields
    URL query string

- Why is session management necessary?
    Because the HTTP protocol is stateless. All of the transactions are independent.

- Do web applications that does not require login need session management?
    In some cases, yes. For example, a web application with a basket.

- What are the 2 categories of the vulnerabilities we can find in session management?
    Weaknesses in the generation of the session tokens
    Weaknesses in the handling of session tokens throughout their life cycle

- Name 1 alternative to session management and describe them
    HTTP authentication
        Like basic, digest, NTLM
        Client interacts with authentication mechanism directly via the browser, using HTTP headers
        The browser re-submit the credentials

- What is the common weaknesses in token generation? Describe them.
    Meaningful tokens
        Based om some user informations (ex: email) and then encoded or obfuscated.
        - Example?
            757365723d6461663b6170703d61646d696e3b646174653d30312f31322f3131
            is in fact en ASCII version of
            user=daf;app=admin;date=10/09/11
        Therefore it is guessable.
        It also disclose internal information (even the architecture) of the application
            Fist and last name
            email address
            IP address
            etc.
    Predictable tokens
        Identifiable pattern for the token generation
        - What are the sources of predictable tokens?
            Conceal sequences
                - Give an example.
                    Add an exadecimal value to the token value for each new token.
            Time dependency
                Do not use time as the input to generate the token (like as the seed), or even the time stamp directly
            Weak random number generation
                In a computer, evrything is pseudorandom, make sure an attacker cannot predict a sequence a token given a single valid token.

- How do you test for the quality of randomness in the session token?
    Sometime it is visually inspectable, or with little manual analysis
    Otherwhise, follow these steps:
        Start with the hypothesis that the tokens are randomly generated
        Apply series of tests, each of which observes specific properties of the sample that are likely to have certain characteristics if the tokens are random
        For each test, calculate the probability of the observed characteristics to occur
        If the probability falls below a certain level, the tokens ar enot randomly generated

- Is there a tool to automate the discovery of the randomness of a token?
    Yes, Burp Sequencer

- Is it safe to use encrypted user information to create the token?
    Not really, there has been cases where an attacker tampered with the token value, wihtout even decrypting it.

- What is the main problem with ECB (electronic codebook) ciphers?
    It takes a string of text and split it in equal size block, then encrypt each block with the same key. Patterns can be dicerned since blocks that have the same content will have the same encryption

    Even without this, it can be possible to leverage an attack. For example, if the application use this cipher to encrypt the suer information for the token, it would be possible to tamper with the data to change the user information (ex: elevate as admin, identify as another user, etc) even when the token is still encrypted

- How does CBC (cipher block chaining) ciphers solve the issue of ECB ciphers?
    It XOR each block with the previous block.

- With which tool could you try to defeat that cipher?
    Burp bit flipper

- It is impossible to capture the session token because SSL is used, true or false?
    False, attacks like XSS can capture the token.

- How could the session token be disclosed?
    MitM on unencrypted (HTTP) connection
    Even when HTTPS is used on authenticated session, sometime a session token is assigned at the home page which is served over HTTP, and is kept once the user is logged in.
    Load resources (ex: images) over HTTTP with the page in HTTPS, the token is still sent with the get requests for the resources
