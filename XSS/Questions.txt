- What is XSS?
    Cross-site Scripting. It is a type of injection. Malicious script is injected into web sites.

- Give a description of XSS.
    It is about breaking out of a data context and entering a code context.

- Where can it occur (be injected)?
    Anywhere a web application uses input from user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

- What are the 2 conditions for XSS to take place?
    Data enters a web application throught an untrusted source
    The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content

- What kind of attacks can be done with XSS?
    Transmiting private data (cookies, session info), redirecting the victim to some place controlled by the attacker, or performing malicious operations on the web site.

- What are the 3 types of XSS?
    Stored XSS
    Reflected XSS
    DOM based XSS (2005)

- Describe each of them.
    Stored XSS
        The injected script is stored on the target servers, like in a DB, a forum, a comment section, etc. The victim then retrieves the script when it requests the stored information.
    Reflected XSS
        The injected script is reflected off the web server, like an error message, a search result, etc. (things that contain parts or all of the user input in the response).
        - How is it delivered to the victim?
            Via another route, like an email or from another web site. When the user is tricked to click on the malicious link, send a malicious form, or browsing a malicious site, the injected code travels the vulnerable website and the attack is reflected to the user browser. Then, browser execute the script.
    DOM based XSS
        At the oposite of the other types of XSS, DOM based XSS does not change the server response, but the client side code contained in the page executes differently due to malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM environment.

        In other words, it is a client side injection as opposed to a server side injection for the other 2.

        An XSS always execute in the browser. But stored/reflected XSS is a server side resposibility, DOM based is executed directly on the client.

        For example, an XSS attack that leverage client side behavior only. (AngularJS..)

        http://www.some.site/page.html#default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

            (The server only sees a request for page.html without any parameters)

- What are the alternative types of XSS (compared to those above)? Define them.
    Both can be stored or reflected.
    Server XSS
        Untrusted user suplied data that is now included in a HTML response generated by the server, the source of the data can be from a request or from a stored location. The vulnerability is on the server side code, the browser simply execute what it is given.
        
        - What are the recommended defenses for server XSS?
            Context-sensitive server side output encoding is the easiest and stringest defense. Input validation or data sanitization can be done, but it is more difficult to get correct.
    Client XSS
        Untrusted user data is used to update the DOM with an unsafe JS call (a call that introduce valid JS in the DOM). The data can come from the DOM or as been sent by the server. 

        - What are the recommended defenses for client XSS?
            Using safe JS APIs. But it is sometime hard to know if the API or feature of the API is safe. Other times, you know the method is not safe, and cannot find an alternative, then you have to fall back on context sensitive ouput encoding in the browser.

- Does the consequence of an XSS change depending of the type used?
    No. The only difference is in how the payload arrives at the server.

- What kind of consequenses? Given some examples.
    Range from annoyance to account compromise. Disclosure of session cookie (session hijacking), disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirect the user, modify presentation content. Example: modify a press release, modify medication dosage.

- How to determine if you are vulnerable?
    Perform a security review of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request could possibly make its way into the HTML output.

- Give alternatives for XSS syntax. (XSS attacks that do not use <script></script> tag) (There are a lot, just give a few)
    Use script in attributes
        <body onload=alert(1)>
        <b onmouseover=alert(1)>Some text to over</b>
        <img src="[...]" onerror=alert(document.cookie)>

    Encoded URI schemes
        If the web application has some filters, we can try to encode string characters (ex: a=&#X41 in UTF-8)
        <img src=j&#X41vascript:alert(1)>

    Code encoding
        Encode the script in Base64 and place it in META tag (<meta> provides metadata about the HTML document, will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.)
        <META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
        CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg">

- How do you protect/prevent your web site against XSS?
    In a nutshell: perform the appropriate validation and escaping on the server-side

    0- Disable HTTP TRACE support: an attacker can steal cookie data via JS even if document.cookie is disabled or not supported.

    1- Whitelist input values if possible (dropdown, numbers only, etc.)

    2- HTML escape before inserting untrusted data into HTML element content.
         String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML( request.getParameter( "input" ) );

    3- Attribute escape before inserting untrusted data into common attributes
        Common attributes are width, name, value, etc. Not: href, src, style, event handlers.
        Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 to prevent switching out of the attribute (ex : <[...] name=input> ---> <[...] name=""> [some malicious injection] <!--)

        String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTMLAttribute( request.getParameter( "input" ) );

    4- JS escape before inserting untrusted data into JS data values
        The only safe place to put untrusted escaped data into JS code is inside a quoted data value. But, there are still JS functions that are never safe, like window.setInterval('ESCAPED DATA IS NOT SAFE');

        Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters less than 256 to prevent switching out of the data value into the script context or into another attribute.

        String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForJavaScript( request.getParameter( "input" ) );

    5- HTML escape JSON values in an HTML context and read the data with JSON.parse
        Ensure returned Content-Type header is application/json and not text/html. This instructs the browser to not misunderstand the context and execute injected script

    6- CSS escape and strictly validate before inserting untrusted data into HTML style property values
        For when you want to put untrusted data into a stylesheet or a style tag. There are css contexts that are never safe, for example all URLs (background-url: "javascript:alert(1)";). Have to ensure that URLs starts with http, not javascript.

        String safe = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForCSS( request.getParameter( "input" ) );

    7- URL escape before inserting untrusted data into URL parameter values
        Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256.

    8- If the use of HTML markup is expected from the user, use a specialized library to handle the sanitization of the user input.

    The use of the HTTPONLY flag on the cookies helps to protect against cookie theft

    Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
        Mitigate XSS by instructing the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources
        Ex: Content-Security-Policy: default-src: 'self'; script-src: 'self' static.domain.tld
            Tells the browser to load all resources only from the page's origin and JS source code files.

    Use the X-XSS-Protection Response Header
        - Is it enabled by default?
            Yes. But it may have been disabled by the user, so better set it to be sure.


    - Can you just Entity encode all untrusted data and be done with it?
        No. entity encoding does not work if you put untrusted data inside a <script> tag, or in an event handler, or in a URL. You MUST use escape syntax for the part of the HTML document you are putting untrusted data into.

- Do web application frameworks provide automatic contextual escaping functionality?
    Some yes, like AngularJS strict contextual escaping

- How do you protect/prevent your web site against DOM based XSS?
    HTML encode and then JS encode the untrusted inputs.

    or

    Populate the DOM using safe JS functions/properties. For example element.testContent = untrustedData will not execute code.

- Are event handlers safe to put user inputs?
    No. Even JS encoded strings will execute. Simply because an event handler will try to execute what it as received as value.

- Which is more viable agaisnt XSS: JS encoding or HTML encoding? Why?
    HTML encoding, because tag elements are well define and does not have an alternate representation. (For example, it cannot be used to allow a developer to have alternate representations of the <a> tag.)

- Give some developement guidelines against DOM based XSS.
    Untrusted data should only be treated as displayable text.

    Always JS encode and delimit untrusted data as quoted strings when entering the application.

    Use document.createElement("") element.setAttribute("","") (not all attributes are safe), element.appendChild("") 

    Avoid use of HTML rendering methods
        element.innerHTML = ""
        document.write("")

- How to test for reflected XSS?
    Find input vectors, analyze each input vector, send malicious input data, check result

    - List some XSS bypass
        "><script >alert(document.cookie)</script >
        "><ScRiPt>alert(document.cookie)</ScRiPt>
        "%3cscript%3ealert(document.cookie)%3c/script%3e
        <scr<script>ipt>alert(document.cookie)</script>

        HTTP parameter pollution

- How to test for stored XSS?
    Similar as reflected XSS

- Is it possible to do stored XSS with an image?
    Yes, if it is possible to change the MIME type of the request:

    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadfile1"; filename="C:\Documents and Settings\test\Desktop\test.gif"
    Content-Type: text/html

    <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

- Is XSS the most prevalent vulnerability?
    Yes.

- Is: "Users get compromised because they are not security-conscious" true?
    Partially. Even cautious users can be XSSed

- Can an XSS be turned into a virus or a self-propagating worm?
    Yes.

- Do websites that offers the remember me feature more exposed to XSS?
    In a way, yes, since the user does not have to be actively logged in for the XSS to have access to user reserved actions.

- Is stored XSS more dangerous than reflected XSS?
    Generally, yes. Does not have to trick the user to login in before sending the payload (social engineering), user already logged in, the attacker just has to wait for the users to hit the infected area.

- Give an example of a DOM based XSS.
    http://somesite.com/error/error.aspx?message=<script>alert(1)</script>
    with the message being processed client-side only

- List some XSS attack payloads.
    Capture session token (session hijacking)
    Virtual defacement
        Feed misleading information to users.
    Injecting trojan functionality
        Trojan forms to capture user credentials
    Inducing user actions
        Use the attack payload itself to the the actions on behalf of the user (instead of doing it by hand). Or even exploit another vulnerability via the payload. That way, the web app logs will point out that the security flaw was exploited by the XSS victim, not the attacker.
    Exploiting any trust relationships
        Autocomplete: if activated, the attacker might not need any interaction from the user to extract the sensitive information
        The browser trusted sites zone is dangerous, any site in this list could start windows programs
        ActiveX controls contains powerful methods
    Easy to escalate the attack

- Phishing and XSS only affect applications on the public Internet, is it true? Why?
    No. XSS bugs can affect any web applications. An internal attack exploits 2 levels of thrust: internal em-mail between colleagues and the browser often trusts corporate web servers more than public Internet.

- List some alternative to deliver reflected and DOM based XSS.
    Broad or targeted email
    Ads (Legetimate, per-click payable ads)
    Tell a friend or send feedback feature.

- Should you be worried about low-risk XSS bug?
    Yes. An attacker will always be more imaginative than you are. (Use minor XSS to inject ActiveX controls into page response, then use that to attack the application)

- How do you find XSS vulnerabilities?
    Automated scripts
        If the anwser contains unmodified malicious payload, it is most likely vulnerable. But you cannot assess that it is exploitable, you need to manually test them.
    Manual testing
        Many applications that blacklist < > " / are still vulnerable to XSS
        <script> black listing can be circumvaint : <ScRiPt> <script > etc.
        Reflected: for each user input, test which one reflects the data, then try to XSS those

- How could an attacker beat signature-based filters?
    Ex: ASP.NET anti-XSS filter returns an error on possible XSS
    Find what character(s) triguered the filter.
    Find an alternative
        Malformed syntax of the script tag 
            Obfuscate
                The tag name (caps, null bytes at any position (<[%00]img ...)) 
                Attributes name
                Attributes delimiters
                HTML encoding: decimal or exadicimal,
                Superflous leading zeros
                Obfuscate the tag bracket (« << // )
                Encode to UTF-7 US-ASCII UTF-16, change the Content-Type so that the browser will know how to interpret the payload
                JS escaping
                    <script>a\u006cert(1);</script>
                Inject the eval command
                If dot is blocked, can use ['the function or the attribute']
                Inject VBScript instead (IE only)

        Event handlers
        Script pseudo protocols: javascript:alert(1)

- How would an attacker beat sanitization?
    All of the above methods
    Try to find mistakes in sanitizing filters
        <script><script>alert(1)</script>
        <scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</script>
        \'

- How would an attacker beat length limits?
    Shorten attack payload (minify it)
    Span the attack across multiple different locations
        <input type=”hidden” name=”page_id” value=””><script>/*”>
        <input type=”hidden” name=”seed” value=”*/alert(document.cookie);/*”>
        <input type=”hidden” name=”mode” value=”*/</script>”
    Convert the reflected XSS to a DOM XSS
        http://somesite.com/error/5/Error.aspx?message=<script>eval(location.hash.slice(1))</script>#alert('My super long script')

- Are XSS bugs in unauthenticated part of a site dangerous? Why?
    Yes, maybe even more than the authenticated one, for 2 reasons
        The range of potential victims is wider
        An attacker can deploy a Trojan functionnality that persists in the victim's browser, wainting the victim to login, or listning to keyboard strokes

- Is it possible to exploit XSS via cookies? How?
    Yes, for example, with user preferences

- Is it possible to exploit XSS via the referer header? How?
    Yes, the victim needs to be tricked to do a request to the attacker's server. Then, the server returns a response that causes a requests to the vulnerable URL, with the attacker payload in the referer header.

- Is it possible to exploit XSS via XML requests? How?
    It is not as trivial as the other methods. It must be introduced in the value of a parameter of the XML. It also need to be doubled HTML encoded (for brackets, etc.) (in form request and in the XML itself)
    Set the Content-Type to text/plain, if it is not supported, you can stop there.

        <xml> <data> ... <a xmlns:a=’http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml’> <a:body onload=’alert(1)’/></a> ... </data> </xml>

    It succeeds only if the response is consumed directly by the browser.

- How does browser XSS filters works?
    In cross-domain requests, each parameter value is inspected to identify attemps to inject JS. Done by regex blacklisting
    If a potentially malicious parameter value is found, the response is checked to see if it contains this same value.
    If the value appears in the response, then it is sanitized

- How could an attacker bypass browser XSS filters?
    Only the values are considered, some application are vulnerable via the attribute name.
    If there are mutliple parameters in the same request, it may be possible to span the attack
    Obfuscation (see above)
    HTTP parameter polution: concatenation of the value of duplicate attribute name in GET request

- How do you test for XSS in web mail applications?
    Use your adress / a specific adress for your test
    If you have difficulties controlling the content of your email, use the UNIX sendmail command.

    sendmail -t test@example.org < email.txt

    MIME-Version: 1.0 
    From: test@example.org 
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii 
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit 
    Subject: XSS test
    <html> <body> <img src=``onerror=alert(1)> </body> </html> 

- How do you test for XSS in uploaded files?
    Try to upload an HTML file and check if your script is executed when you download it back. If the answer is yes, then it is certainly vulnerable.

    If it blocks the html, change the content-type to text or jpeg, but still send HTML content
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
        Content-Length: 25
        Content-Type: image/jpeg
        <script>alert(1)</script>

- How do test for XSS with AJAX?
    http://somesite.com/#profiles/images/1234455654.jpg

    which is an image that contains HTML

- How to test for DOM based XSS?
    Send payload in each URL possible variation
        “<script>alert(1)</script> 
        “;alert(1)// 
        ‘-alert(1)-’
        #<script>alert(1)</script> (everything after # is not sent to the server)
    Add a foo parameter to the URL

    Some tools exist for that

- At this point, there is an automated tool that can reliably identify all XSS bugs?
    No.

- What is the root cause of reflected and stored XSS?
    It is that user-controllable data is copied into application responses without adequate validation and sanitization.

- How do you prevent reflected and stored XSS? Enumerate the three (complementary) approaches.
    Validate input
    Validate output
    Eliminate dangerous insertion points

- How do you implement input validation? Name three techniques.
    Data is not too long
    Data contains only certain permitted set of characters
    Data matches a particular regex

- How do you implement output validation?
    The data or partial data that comes from the user should be HTML-encoded to sanitize potentially malicious characters.
    - How does this encoding gets interpreted by the browser?
        The browser will handle potentially malicious characters in a safe way, treating them as part of the content of the HTML document, not part of its structure.

- Which is more important, input or output validation?
    Output validation, it is the more effective of them. Input validation should be seen as a complementary/secondary.

- How would you securely implement an input that needs to accept HTML markup?
    Use a library such as OWASP AntiSamy
    Implement a limited intermediary language that is then transformed in HTML

- How do you validate input and output for DOM-based XSS?
    Validate input:
        Same as above, but client-side
    Validate output:
        Same as above, HTML encoding

- What is the name of the Microsoft library that mitigate XSS?
    Anti-XSS (encoding for CSS, HTML, JS, etc.)
